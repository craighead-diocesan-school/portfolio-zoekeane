    <h2> My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was a punching machine.
    <p>After being told our task for the term, we began by assembling an intelligent group. Sadly, I was away whilst the groups were being decided, so I was left with Montana, Charlotte, and Amelia.
