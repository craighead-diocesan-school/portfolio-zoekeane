      <h2> My Project</h2>
      <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My
        project was a punching machine.
      <h3> The Beginning </h3>
      <p>After being told our task for the term, we began by assembling an intelligent group. Sadly, I was away whilst
        the groups were being decided, but luckily I was left with Montana, Charlotte, and Amelia. We started by making
        a plan, we brainstormed different ideas on how to make our punching machine and got started on the structure
        right away.

      </p>
      <h3> The Construction </h3>
      <p> We began to assemble a structure for our punching machine out of Epro8. We made a life sized box out of the
        Epro8 as our base structure. We weren't 100% sure if this structure would be right, but we made it anyway. We
        also had to construct a fist to put on top of our structure as advertisement. This turned out to be harder then
        we intended. We began to construct it out of paper mache, but this turned out to be unsuccesful. The paper mache
        was too weak, and the more we tried to mould clay to the top of it, the more it fell apart. After quite sometime
        of trial and error Montana succesfully began to make the fist out of paper and tinfoil. She used our original
        paper mache idea, but instead of using a balloon as the base she used tinfoil. Making it stronger and easier to
        shape. </p>
      <p> Next we began to make the punching bag aswell as the code for the machine. Amelia mainly did the code, while
        Charlotte and I did more constructing on the machince, and Montana continued making the fist. One of the issues
        we came across was how to attach the punching bag to the base structure, but also how we would make the punching
        bag! We decided after some discussion that the punching bag would be made out of a pillow that Amelia would sew
        in Design. We would then velcro the punching bag on to a piece of strong cardboard. Charlotte and I decided we
        would attached the Pillow or "Punching bag" by ziptying the attached cardboard to two Epro8 poles in a H shape.
        We used a hinge to then attach the H shaped poles and punching bag to the main structure. This also insured the
        punching bag swung when it got punched.
      </p>
      <h3> The Code</h3>
      <p> In order to get a score when the punching bag was punched, we had to code a microbit. We coded it so that it
        measured the speed the punching bag moved after being punched. The faster the bag move, the harder the punch
        was. </p>
      <h3> The Finale</h3>
      <p> As market day grew closer and closer we had to work harder to finish on time. Amelia finished the coding the
        microbit but we were unsure how we would view the score that appears on the microbit, considering it was
        attached to the back of the punching bag, out of view. We discussed, and Amelia came up with the outstanding
        idea of coding a second microbit so that when the Punching bag was hit, a score would show up on a second
        microbit. We often had issues figuring out how we would attach different things to our base structure, and many
        times it came back to using zipties, thanks to Mr Hullen. We attached the punching bag to the H shaped poles
        with zipties and also attached the first microbit to the bag using zipties. Zipties were used.. ALOT.

      <p> With the fist being completed for advertisment we attached it, with zipties of course, to the base structure
        on top of the gears so it would spin when turned on. When the fist was first attached it spun swiftly on top of
        the sturdy structure, but as we added more gears to slow the spin, the bolts from the gears began to crash
        against eachother. This was a very annoying problem, not only because it threatened to make our fist fall, but
        also because the sound of crashing bolts was infuriating. But with very little hassle we moved the gears and the
        problem with the bolts was solved. Charlotte and I designed signs for our Punching Machine, printed and
        laminated them. With it nearly being market day we just had to gather a whiteboard as our leaderboard, and some
        final touches before we were ready to share our game to the school. </p>

      <h3> Market Day!!!!</h3>
      <p> Before we knew it the day was here.. Market Day! We thought we were pretty prepared, so we weren't stressing
        too much. As I also take Buisness class I was sadly not able to help run the punching machine on the day, but I
        tried my best to come across and see how the group was going every so often. Overall the day was pretty
        successful, except for a slight problem witht the "punching bag" falling off everything else went smoothly. We
        had Mr Jones come over and have a punch but he still didn't take 1st place. Greer Pratt, a year 9 student ended
        up on the top of the leaderboard by the end of the day, winning $10. We made a total of $30 which isn't alot,
        but considering it was only $2 per punch we didn't do too bad. With the winning prize being $10 we ended up
        making $5 each between the 4 of us. </p>
      <p> That is the story of how our Punching machine came to life. I hope you enjoyed and learn't something new. </p>
